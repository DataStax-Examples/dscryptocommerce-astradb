# Summary

This application will showcase how to interact with data from both a Serverless Database and Blockchain in an Ecommerce Store. Product information such as the product description, name, and price will be stored in a Serverless Cassandra Database. Payment related transactions are executed on the blockchain. AstraDB is used as the database and Rinkeby Testnet is used for the blockchain. In addition, the actual product images are stored in a AWS S3 bucket.

## Components

- DataStax Astra DB (stores operational data)
- Metamask Wallet
- AWS S3 (stores product images)

This application demo will walk through a series of transactions between a buyer and seller. The transactions demonstrated will be:
* Seller listing the product (listing fee: 0.025ETH)
* Buyer placing a bid on the product (product price: 0.1ETH + listing fee: 0.025ETH)
* Seller will ship the product (returned the listing fee: 0.025ETH)
* Buyer will confirm receipt of the product (returned the listing fee: 0.025ETH | seller receives product price: 0.1ETH)

## Objectives
* Set up a Metamask Wallet
* Deploy a serverless database, create tables, and insert data
* Application walk through

## Prerequisites
Let's do some initial setup:
1. Creating a Serverless Database with AstraDB
2. Set up your Amazon S3 Bucket
3. Download and install the [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension
4. Connect your wallet to the Rinkeby Testnet
5. Create multiple accounts within Metamask
6. Fund the wallet with Test Tokens using the [Rinkeby Faucet](https://rinkebyfaucet.com/)

## Start Building

### DataStax Astra
<!--- enter a unique UTM_CODE for your sample app below --->
1. Create a [DataStax Astra account](https://astra.datastax.com/register?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=UTM_CODE) if you don't already have one:
   ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Examples/sample-app-template/master/screenshots/astra-register-basic-auth.png)

2. On the home page. Locate the button **`Create Database`**
   ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Examples/sample-app-template/master/screenshots/astra-dashboard.png)

3. Locate the **`Get Started`** button to continue
   ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Examples/sample-app-template/master/screenshots/astra-select-plan.png)

4. Define a **database name: `Cryptocommerce`**, **keyspace name: `ecommerce`** and select a database **region**, then click **create database**.
   ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Examples/sample-app-template/master/screenshots/astra-create-db.png)

5. Your Astra DB will be ready when the status will change from *`Pending`* to **`Active`** ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥
   ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Examples/sample-app-template/master/screenshots/astra-db-active.png)

6. After your database is provisioned, we need to generate an Application Token for our App. Go to the `Settings` tab in the database home screen.
   ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Examples/sample-app-template/master/screenshots/astra-db-settings.png)

7. Select `Admin User` for the role for this Sample App and then generate the token. Download the CSV so that we can use the credentials we need later.
   ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataStax-Examples/sample-app-template/master/screenshots/astra-db-settings-token.png)

8. After you have your Application Token, head to the database connect screen and copy the connection information. Add your `ASTRA DATABASE ID`, `ASTRA DATABASE REGION`, `KEYSPACE NAME`, AND `TOKEN VALUE` to the .env.example file. Save that file as a `.env` file.

    name text,
    seller_address text,
    tokenId text,
