# Summary

This application will showcase how to interact with data from both a Serverless Database and Blockchain in an Ecommerce Store. Product information such as the product description, name, and price will be stored in a Serverless Cassandra Database. Payment related transactions are executed on the blockchain. AstraDB is used as the database and Rinkeby Testnet is used for the blockchain. In addition, the actual product images are stored in a AWS S3 bucket.

## Components

- DataStax Astra DB (stores operational data)
- Metamask Wallet
- AWS S3 (stores product images)

This application demo will walk through a series of transactions between a buyer and seller. The transactions demonstrated will be:
* Seller listing the product (listing fee: 0.025ETH)
* Buyer placing a bid on the product (product price: 0.1ETH + listing fee: 0.025ETH)
* Seller will ship the product (returned the listing fee: 0.025ETH)
* Buyer will confirm receipt of the product (returned the listing fee: 0.025ETH | seller receives product price: 0.1ETH)

## Prerequisites
Let's do some initial setup:
1. Creating a Serverless Database with AstraDB
2. Download and install the [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension
3. Connect your wallet to the Rinkeby Testnet
4. Create multiple accounts within Metamask
5. Fund the wallet with Test Tokens using the [Rinkeby Faucet](https://rinkebyfaucet.com/)

### DataStax Astra

6. After your database is provisioned, we need to generate an Application Token for our App. Go to the `Settings` tab in the database home screen.

7. Select `Admin User` for the role for this Sample App and then generate the token. Download the CSV so that we can use the credentials we need later.

8. After you have your Application Token, head to the database connect screen and copy the connection information that we'll need later. We'll replace `ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN` with the `Token` value that is part of your Application Token.
